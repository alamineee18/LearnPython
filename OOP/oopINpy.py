# OOP in python 
# To map with real world scenarios, we started using objects in code.
# This is called object oriented programming. 

# --------------------------------------

# Class and Object in Python
# Class is a blueprint for creating objects.

# creating class 
class Student:
    name = "Karan Kumar"
    def __init__(self):
        print("Adding new student in Database..")
    

# creating object (instance)
s1 = Student()
print(s1.name)

# Constractor 


for x in range():
    pass


# class Car:
#     color = "blue"
#     brand = "mercedes"

# car1 = Car()
# print(car1.color)
# print(car1.brand)
